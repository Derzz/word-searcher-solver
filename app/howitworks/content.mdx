# How It Works

This project uses Next.js, Typescript, and Tesseract.js.

To determine how to find the word, a search is conducted for each word in the grid in each direction. Once the word is found, the grid is highlighted based on a random color and thus the word can be found.

Tesseract.js is used to recognize grid images and fill in the grid based on what it sees.
